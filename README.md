# overview

This project used svelteKit and firebase, page routes are defined in src/routes which map to paths,
e.g. src/routes/login means you go to /login to see the pages info.

I got most of my info on how this works from these documentation pages

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/build)
- [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/overview)
